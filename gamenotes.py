		#anything we hae drawn inside of whle loop, we want to display to the player
		#therefore we have to take it and actually put it on the dsplay surface. Like pygame init once you call it you don't have to worry about it anyore

#NOTE1: do not run the code before putting a player input as there is no way to exit the window wthout the code inside the loop for the player to close the window
#NOTE2: pygame.error: video system not initialized ** This is because whenever we have pygame.init which starts pygame and pygame.quit they are polar opposites
	#so we are still closing pygame and having the while loop open so we need to end that whle loop on the spot, most secure is through sys module and close any type of code interily so from sys import exit then call exit under the pygame.quit()
#NOTE3: we dont want our game to run to fast and to run too slow we want t to be constant so we need to wearry of our frame rate and pxels 60 fps - for ceiling and floor
	#computer can run game slower but cant run faster than it's capable of runnng

#NOTE4: regular surface - essentiall a sngle mage (somethng mported, rendered text or a plain color) - 
	 #it needs to be placed on the display surface to be visible 
	 #you can have as many regular surfaces as you want, only dsplayed when connect to the display surface whch is unique and s always vsible
#NOTE5: python order matters
#NOTE6: How to animate in pygame. We are not drawing static image, but we are updating the image over and over again 60 times a second and placing it in the same place
	# animating each just means changing the position slight on each frame
#NOTE7: Rectangles, Precise positioning of surfaces, helps avoid basic collisions 
#NOTE8: the player character. Keyboard input, jump + gravity, creating a floor
	#two ways to get keyboard input is with method or through event loop
		#Keyboard input in the event loop 1. check if any button was pressed 2 work with a specific key
			#there's two methods because when using classes you want the controls isnide of the relevant class. Pygame.mouse and pygame.keys are great for that
	# creating the floor, check the collision between player and floor and move player up if collision
		#all the we really need is to check y position of the player player.bottom > 300: player.bottom = 300
#NOTE9 game over state when are checkng if the snal rectangle s coliding with the colde rectangle
	#game and game over - when player colldes with object it will stop the game and show the score. We need to put the entire game in an if statement. This is basic logic and not recommended 


#NOTE10 We now want to continously update our score so we 1 need to update score on every frame, 2 put that
	#that on a surface 3 display that surface
